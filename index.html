      <h1>COVID-19’s impact on women’s employment </h1>
      <p>
        Women around the world have been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has heightened the large and small inequalities—both at work and at home—that women face daily. 
        However, before COVID-19, women had slowly been making some progress in the workplace. Although the total number is still slightly less than men's overall labor force, since 1984, women's labor participation rate has gradually increased to 47% of the total labor force in 2020.

        Over the past years, there is a clear trend that the percentage of women population decreases as the level in workforce goes up. It might indicate the fact that women are less likely to take leadership position due to marriage, pregnancy, and dominance of men power. Even though more than three fourths of men takes the C-suite roles, but there is an improving ratio in recent years. It indicates a more welcoming environment and inclusiveness as human approach better gender equality.

      <h1>However, Covid led to a major setback in female’s employment status.</h1>
      <div id="sec3-1">
        <p>
          Despite the progress that seemed to be made for females in the workforce, the outbreak of Covid canceled that progress and dealt a severe blow to their employment status. The unemployment rate spiked to 15.1%, and although it has been decreasing over time since hitting the maximum in April, it is still considerably higher than before the pandemic. In fact, looking at the bars indicating 2020 March and April, it is possible to check a sudden rise in the unemployment rate after the pandemic in April. Although the unemployment rate decreased for both men and women after the pandemic, its effect is much more detrimental for women.

          One reason we could think of is the structure of the economy and the composition of the job market. Women make up two-thirds of the part-time workers and 62% of the low-wage workers. These jobs are the servers at restaurants, the housekeeping staff at hotels or shops, the cashiers, and workers in small businesses. These people are going through reduced hours of working and thus wage, or being laid off more easily as businesses are shutting down as the pandemic persists. Moreover, almost 75% of people working for part time is involuntary, meaning that they are working for economic reason and had no choice other than working as a part time, which suggests  the increase in economic insecurity these female part time workers are going to face will worsen as the situation persists.

        <p>
          Also, another reason is that the women tend to carry more burden of childcare than men. Even if they are working, women are expected to and actually carry out more child care. This finding is discovered across all races ranging from white to hispanic, showing that this phenomenon is not limited to one particular race, but a problem that makes many women in general to suffer. During pandemic, many school and nursery shut down or became inacessible due to lock down, which made many women unable to carry out their work and childcare at the same time.

            This figure actually shows that there is no requirement for equal treatment in US federal law beyond minimum standards guaranteed to all workers. Some states may require equal treatment. Regulations do not ensure equal treatment of regular workers and agency workers at the user firm.

          <h3>
            Is the US experiencing increase in the number of employed females?<br>
            Not really.
          </h3>
          <p>
            In summary, the US government has been doing an ineffective job to ensure females’ employment status. In some ways, the detrimental effect of Covid on female unemployment was an inevitable outcome in a situation where government support and buffer to prevent women from being marginalized in a job market is lacking significantly. Their investment in family benefits has been decreasing, and there are no regulations that guarantee the status of temporary workers when the majority of part-time workers are female. This might be something the US government has to consider seriously.
