    <h1>COVID-19’s impact on women’s employment </h1>
    <div class="main-section" id="sec1">
      <p>
        Women around the world have been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has heightened the large and small inequalities—both at work and at home—that women face daily. 
        However, before COVID-19, women had slowly been making some progress in the workplace. Although the total number is still slightly less than men's overall labor force, since 1984, women's labor participation rate has gradually increased to 47% of the total labor force in 2020.

      </div>
      <p>
        There is a clear trend that the percentage of women population decreases as the level in workforce goes up. It might indicate the fact that women are less likely to take leadership position due to marriage, pregnancy, and dominance of men power. Even though more than three fourths of men takes the C-suite roles, but there is an improving ratio in recent years. It indicates a more welcoming environment and inclusiveness as human approach better gender equality.

      <p>
        In the short-term, women’s enmployement rate is constantly fluatuating, the reasons behind this might include the progression of AI to replace low-skilled labor and changing economic environment. In the long-term, women’s unemployment rate is gradually decreasing, so more women are more capable of and willing to work rather than being a housewife after marriage. The corporations and government is encouraging more gender equity by There are two significant increase, one in 2008 due to economic recession and the other in 2020 due to COVID-19.

      <h4>Male and Female Unemployment Rate in 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Despite the progress that seemed to be made for females in the workforce, the outbreak of Covid canceled that progress and dealt a severe blow to their employment status. The unemployment rate spiked to 15.1%, and although it has been decreasing over time since hitting the maximum in April, it is still considerably higher than before the pandemic. In fact, looking at the bars indicating 2020 March and April, it is possible to check a sudden rise in the unemployment rate after the pandemic in April. Although the unemployment rate decreased for both men and women after the pandemic, its effect is much more detrimental for women.

        One reason we could think of is the structure of the economy and the composition of the job market. Women make up two-thirds of the part-time workers and 62% of the low-wage workers. These jobs are the servers at restaurants, the housekeeping staff at hotels or shops, the cashiers, and workers in small businesses. These people are going through reduced hours of working and thus wage, or being laid off more easily as businesses are shutting down as the pandemic persists. Moreover, almost 75% of people working for part time is involuntary, meaning that they are working for economic reason and had no choice other than working as a part time, which suggests  the increase in economic insecurity these female part time workers are going to face will worsen as the situation persists.

      <h4>Percentage of working male or female engaging in childcare</h4>
      <p>
        Women tend to carry more burden of childcare than men. Even if they are working, women are expected to and are actually carrying out more child care. This finding is discovered across all races ranging from white to hispanic, showing that this phenomenon is not limited to one particular race, but a problem that makes many women in general to suffer. During pandemic, many school and nursery shut down or became inacessible due to lock down, which made many women unable to carry out their work and childcare at the same time.

      <p>
        When we dived into the dataset of the percent of total employed rate between men and women, we can figure out that women with children in all different age groups are tended to have lower employment rates. The younger the child, the higher the unemployment rate for women. Since young children require more supervision, many of these parents are unable to work as long as daycare center closures continue and other forms of childcare remain unavailable.

      <p>
        The Women unemployment rate grew higher when they have younger kids. There is a special insight that caught my attention, that is, women without children tend to have the highest unemployment rate. We can reasonably suspect that in addition to the child factor, there are still other factors that lead to the unemployment situation of women.

In some ways, the detrimental effect of Covid on female unemployment was an inevitable outcome in a situation where government support and buffer to prevent women from being marginalized in a job market is lacking significantly.
