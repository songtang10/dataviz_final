Abstract: 

Female employment is an important issue in the topic of the women's rights movement. Back in the days when females were treated as inferior to the male population, they had limited or no legal right to possess property or faced extremely high barriers or limitations in the job market. For our project, we are interested in examining the different aspects of women's employment status and whether COVID has any significant impact on them.

Process: 

After collecting datasets, we discussed and settled an overall narrative structure, which would be categorized into four sections. Then, we designated different sections for each team member, and we individually added a more detailed narrative and created visualizations. Then, in the interim meeting, we critiqued our visualizations together and saw what kind of narrative or evidence was missing from our article. We gave feedback to the narrative and the design, so we iteratively improved our article over a few interim meetings. Additionally, Tia Tang was in charge of setting up and working with our group's github repository. She transferred our team's figma design into an accessible html format.
